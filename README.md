# Cellular Automata Generator

## The "What" of this Package

* Given a Rules object, one can specify how to generate a cellular automata

* Flexiblity in state as well as displaying characters

* Provides an easy framework to print and update the Cellular Automata, including timing, size of the grid, and maximum iterations

## Motivation

Personally, Cellular Automata are a fascinating subject!

Although there are a lot of academic papers which discuss the various applications of this simple concept, there was no simple way to generalize creating cellular automata.

Although this may not be the most optimal solution, it supports a variety of options that seem helpful instead of having to code all of the special cases.

## Installation

To use this package using npm:

~~~shell
npm install automata-gen
~~~

or using yarn:

~~~shell
yarn add automata-gen
~~~

## Personal Note

Cellular Automata generator is the first package I have ever dared to publish.

The culmination of my learning and exposure to the programming community is this package.

Many beginner programmers have coded Conway's game of life, and I hope this contribution can help those understand the power of these simple simulations.

Thank you,
